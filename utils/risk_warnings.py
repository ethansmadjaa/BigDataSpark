        ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Hey, Listen Up!
        
        **This is just for learning! Don't use it for real trading!!**
        
        Stuff that can go wrong:
        - Markets are crazy: stonks go up AND down üìàüìâ
        - Technical analysis isn't magic: patterns don't always work
        - Data might be wrong or delayed (yeah it happens)
        - We're not financial advisors lol
        
        What you should do:
        - Do ur own research (srsly)
        - Talk to actual pros who know stuff
        - Know what you're getting into
        - Check multiple sources (not just us)
        
        *If you use this, you're on your own! Don't blame us if things go south.*
